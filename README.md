BQ27427 Battery Fuel Gauge Arduino Library
==========================================

The Texas Instruments [BQ27427](https://www.ti.com/product/BQ27427) battery fuel gauge is a single-cell gauge that requires minimal user configuration and system microcontroller firmware development, leading to quick system bring-up -- it measures your battery's voltage to estimate its charge percentage and remaining capacity. The chip contains an internal current-sensing resistor, which allows it to measure current and power!

This Arduino library abstracts away all of the low-level I2C communication, so you can easily initialize the fuel gauge then read voltage, state-of-charge, current, power, and capacity. It also implements all of the chip's low-battery, and SoC-change alerts on the GPOUT pin.
